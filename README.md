# Restaurant menu-page
## Description
Thank you for checking out the project. This is a restaurant menu page with content loaded dynamically from javascript file to the html file. This is a static page which shows menu of foods and you can choose a 
dish according to time of day. There are 5 buttons. <br>
1. All 
2. Breakfast 
3. Lunch 
4. Shakes 
5. Dinner 

The dishes are shown in form of cards with an image, title, price and a description.
## Working
The data is saved as an object in a menu array with 6 key value pairs. <br>
1. id: 1
2. title: "buttermilk pancakes",
3. category: "breakfast",
4. price: 15.99,
5. img: "./images/item-1.jpeg",
6. desc: `I'm baby woke mlkshk wolf bitters live-edge blue bottle, hammock freegan copper mug whatever cold-pressed `

Adding a new dish is as simple as adding a new object to the array and it will get added to the page.
